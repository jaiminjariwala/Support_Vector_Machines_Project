# Goal: To use a Wine Dataset to develop a Machine Learning Model that attempts to predict if a wine is "Legit" or "Fraud" based on Various Chemical Features!

I have Uploaded a CSV File of the Wine Dataset as well as Image:)

**Imports done are:**

**import numpy as np** <br>
**import pandas as pd** <br> 
**import matplotlib.pyplot as plt** <br> 
**import seaborn as sns** <br> 

**from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split** <br>
**from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler** (for scaling the values) <br>

**from sklearn.svm import SVC** (imported Support Vector Classifier from 'svm' module) <br>
**from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV** (for to get the best HyperParameter) <br>

**from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix, classification_report, plot_confusion_matrix** (for measuring the performance of the model)
